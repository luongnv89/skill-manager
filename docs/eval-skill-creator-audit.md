# `asm eval` ↔ skill-creator v1.7.1 audit

Audit of literal MUST rules from the canonical skill-creator standard
(`~/.claude/skills/skill-creator/SKILL.md`, v1.7.1) against the two built-in
`asm eval` providers, run for issue #246.

The standard's "Frontmatter Audit on Review/Evaluation (mandatory)" section
(lines 134–150 of skill-creator's SKILL.md) is the primary source. Heuristic
prose advice (word count targets, imperative-verb openings, body length
sweet spots, etc.) is **out of scope** — those are quality-of-prose
suggestions the evaluator scores on its own, not literal standard mandates.

## Findings

### Combined coverage across both providers is complete for 8 of 11 rules

Rules 1, 2, 5, 8 have full coverage in both providers. Rules 3, 4, 6, 7, 9
are fully covered by `skill-best-practice` (which is the literal-validation
provider) and partially or not by `quality` (which is the scoring provider).

### Three gaps in `quality` where `skill-best-practice` already enforces strictly

| Rule | Gap in `quality`                                             | Already covered (strictly) by                     |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 4    | description single-line + angle brackets + 1024-char ceiling | `skill-best-practice` `description-shape` (error) |
| 6    | unknown top-level keys silently ignored                      | `skill-best-practice` `allowed-keys` (error)      |
| 9    | `effort` enum not validated                                  | `skill-best-practice` `effort-enum` (error)       |

For each: **`skill-best-practice` will fail the skill outright** when the
rule is violated. `quality` will score it without comment. The user-facing
behavior of `asm eval` (which runs both providers) therefore already flags
every violation — just from a different provider — and fails the overall
verdict because `skill-best-practice` returns `passed: false`.

Adding the same checks to `quality` would:

- Duplicate the finding (two providers emit the same complaint)
- Force snapshot regeneration of `src/eval/providers/quality/v1/fixtures/*.json`
  (the corpus snapshot tests)
- Blur the architectural line: `quality` becomes a validator alongside the
  scoring layer, and the two providers' findings overlap

### One partial gap in `quality` (rule 3)

`scoreNaming`'s regex (`^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*$`) tolerates trailing hyphens
(`my-skill-`), consecutive hyphens (`my--skill`), and lengths 41–64. The
standard forbids the first two and allows up to 64. `skill-best-practice`'s
`name-kebab-case` enforces all the rules strictly (error severity) — same
double-coverage logic as the gaps above.

### Two genuine uncovered rules (10, 11) — neither provider checks them

- **Rule 10 (YAML safety)**: PR #248 Decision Record explains the deferral.
  By the time `parseYaml()` succeeds the original quoting is lost, and a
  naive regex would flag almost every skill. The only documented failure
  mode (unquoted `:` in `description`) already breaks YAML parsing, which
  `skill-best-practice` catches as `invalid-yaml`. Tracked as a follow-up
  if a real-world need surfaces.
- **Rule 11 (`docs/README.md` consistency)**: cross-file consistency check
  comparing frontmatter `name`/`description`/`author` against the
  human-readable copy in `docs/README.md`. Not implemented in either
  provider. Worth a follow-up issue if the catalog starts depending on this.

## Conclusion

PR #248 brings `skill-best-practice` to full literal-rule coverage of the
v1.7.1 standard for the 9 rules it covers (1–9, minus the two deferred).
`quality` keeps its scoring-layer role; the hard-validation duplications it
lacks are all caught by `skill-best-practice` so the user-facing
`asm eval` verdict is correct without modifying `evaluator.ts`.

Two open follow-ups (rules 10 and 11) are uncovered by either provider and
should be tracked as separate issues if/when the need is concrete.
