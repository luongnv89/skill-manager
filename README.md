## Your AI agent skills are a mess

You use Claude Code at work, Codex for side projects, and OpenClaw for experiments. Each tool keeps skills in its own hidden directory with its own conventions. Here's what that looks like in practice:

- **Skills scattered everywhere** — `~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.codex/skills/`, `~/.openclaw/skills/`, project-level `.claude/skills/`... you have the same skill installed three times and can't remember which version is where
- **No visibility** — there's no quick way to see what's installed, what's duplicated, or what's outdated across all your agents
- **Installing is manual and risky** — you clone repos, copy folders, hope the SKILL.md is valid, and pray you didn't just install something that exfiltrates your codebase

The more AI agents you use, the worse this gets. Every new tool adds another skill directory to babysit.

## `asm` brings order to the chaos

**agent-skill-manager** is a single command that manages skills across every AI coding agent you use. One TUI. One CLI. Every agent.

- **See everything at once** — List, search, and filter skills across all providers and scopes from one dashboard. No more `ls`-ing through hidden directories.
- **Install from GitHub in one command** — `asm install github:user/repo` handles cloning, validation, and placement. Supports single-skill repos, multi-skill collections, subfolder URLs, and private repos via SSH.
- **Catch problems before they bite** — Built-in security scanning flags dangerous patterns (shell execution, network access, credential exposure, obfuscation) before you install. Duplicate audit finds and cleans redundant skills across providers.
- **Create and test skills locally** — Scaffold new skills with `asm init`, symlink them for live development with `asm link`, audit for security issues, and verify metadata — all before publishing. [See the full local dev workflow &darr;](#build-test-and-ship-your-own-skills)
- **Works with every major agent** — 15 providers built-in: Claude Code, Codex, OpenClaw, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, Roo Code, Continue, GitHub Copilot, Aider, OpenCode, Zed, Augment, Amp, and a generic Agents provider. Add custom providers in seconds via config.
- **Two interfaces, one tool** — Full interactive TUI with keyboard navigation, search, and detail views. Or use the CLI with `--json` for scripting and automation.

  <br/><em>asm stats — totals, disk usage, and per-provider breakdown at a glance</em>
</p>

## How it works

1. **Install `asm`** — one command via npm, Bun, or curl
2. **Run `asm`** — it auto-discovers skills across all configured agent directories
3. **Manage everything** — install, search, inspect, audit, and uninstall skills from the TUI or CLI
4. **Stay safe** — security scan skills before installing, detect duplicates, and clean up with confidence

## Build, Test, and Ship Your Own Skills

`asm` isn't just for consuming skills — it's the complete toolkit for **creating, developing, auditing, and testing skills locally** before you share them.

### 1. Scaffold a new skill

Interactive mode — pick a target tool:

```bash
asm init my-skill
```

Scaffold directly into Claude Code:

```bash
asm init my-skill -p claude
```

Scaffold in a custom directory:

```bash
asm init my-skill --path ./skills
```

This creates a `my-skill/SKILL.md` with valid YAML frontmatter and a markdown template ready to fill in.

### 2. Develop with live reload via symlink

Symlink into Claude Code's skill directory:

```bash
asm link ./my-skill -p claude
```

Or into Codex, or any other tool:

```bash
asm link ./my-skill -p codex
```

Edit the source files — changes are reflected immediately in the agent. No reinstall needed. This is the fastest iteration loop for skill development.

### 3. Audit your skill for security issues

Audit an installed skill by name:

```bash
asm audit security my-skill
```

Audit a local directory:

```bash
asm audit security ./path/to/my-skill
```

Audit every installed skill:

```bash
asm audit security --all
```

The security scanner flags dangerous patterns — shell execution, network access, credential exposure, obfuscation, and external URLs — so you can catch problems before users install your skill.

### 4. Inspect and verify metadata

Check name, version, description, file count:

```bash
asm inspect my-skill
```

Machine-readable output for CI:

```bash
asm inspect my-skill --json
```

### 5. Test the install flow locally

Once your skill is on GitHub, verify that end users can install it cleanly.

Install your own skill as a user would:

```bash
asm install github:you/awesome-skill
```

Install to a specific tool:

```bash
asm install github:you/awesome-skill -p claude
```

Install a specific skill from a multi-skill repo:

```bash
asm install github:you/skills --path skills/awesome-skill
```

Force reinstall to test upgrades:

```bash
asm install github:you/awesome-skill --force
```

Non-interactive install (useful for CI):

```bash
asm install github:you/awesome-skill -p claude --yes --json
```

This catches issues that local development misses — broken repo structure, missing files, invalid frontmatter in a clean install context.

### Typical local development workflow

1. **Scaffold** — `asm init awesome-skill -p claude`
2. Edit your `SKILL.md`
3. **Link for live testing** — `asm link ./awesome-skill -p claude`
4. Test with your AI agent
5. **Security audit** — `asm audit security awesome-skill`
6. **Verify metadata** — `asm inspect awesome-skill`
7. Push to GitHub
8. **Verify install flow** — `asm install github:you/awesome-skill`

Whether you're building skills for yourself or publishing them for the community, `asm` gives you the full create → develop → audit → ship pipeline in one tool.

---

## Skill Verification

Skills indexed by `asm` are automatically evaluated against a set of verification criteria. Skills that pass all criteria receive a **verified** badge in the catalog and `"verified": true` in the index JSON. Skills that fail any criterion are still indexed but marked as unverified.

### Verification Criteria

A skill must satisfy **all four** of the following to be verified:

1. **Valid frontmatter** -- The SKILL.md file must contain YAML frontmatter with both a `name` and a `description` field. Empty or whitespace-only values fail this check.

2. **Meaningful body content** -- The markdown body (everything after the frontmatter block) must contain at least 20 characters of instruction text. A SKILL.md that is only frontmatter with no real guidance for the agent will fail.

3. **No malicious patterns** -- The full SKILL.md content is scanned for dangerous code patterns:
   - `atob()` calls (runtime base64 decoding / obfuscation)
   - Suspicious base64-encoded strings (40+ character base64 blocks with padding)
   - Hex-escape sequences (4+ consecutive `\xNN` escapes)
   - Hardcoded credentials (`API_KEY`, `SECRET_KEY`, or `PASSWORD` assignments)

4. **Proper structure** -- The skill directory must exist and contain a `SKILL.md` file that the ingestion pipeline can read.

### How to Reproduce Locally

You can verify your skill before publishing:

```bash
# Index your repo -- verification runs automatically during ingestion
asm index ingest github:your-user/your-repo

# Check the output JSON for the verified field
asm index search "your-skill" --json
```

Each indexed skill in the output JSON includes `"verified": true` or `"verified": false`. If verification fails, the ingestion debug log (set `ASM_DEBUG=1`) prints the specific reasons.

## FAQ

**Is it free?**
Yes. `asm` is MIT licensed and free forever. No accounts, no telemetry, no paywalls.

**Is it actively maintained?**
v1.12.0 shipped on March 23, 2026. The project has had 12 releases in the past week. Check the [changelog](docs/CHANGELOG.md) for the full history.

**Which AI agents does it support?**
15 providers built-in: Claude Code, Codex, OpenClaw, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, Roo Code, Continue, GitHub Copilot, Aider, OpenCode, Zed, Augment, Amp, and a generic Agents provider. All 15 are enabled by default; disable any you don't need via `asm config edit`. You can also add any custom agent that stores skills as directories with a `SKILL.md` file.

**How does it compare to managing skills manually?**
Manual management means remembering where each agent stores skills, cloning repos by hand, checking for duplicates yourself, and having no security scanning. `asm` automates all of that with one command.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/screenshots/asm-audit.png" alt="asm audit — duplicate detection across providers" width="700" />
  <br/><em>asm audit — finds duplicate groups and tells you exactly which to keep</em>
</p>

**Can I use it with private repos?**
Yes. Use `--transport ssh` or `--transport auto` to clone private repos via SSH.

**Is it safe to install skills from GitHub?**
`asm` includes built-in security scanning that flags dangerous patterns (shell execution, network access, credential exposure, obfuscation) before installation. Run `asm audit security github:user/repo` to scan any skill before installing.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/screenshots/asm-audit-security-oss-ready.png" alt="asm audit security — security scanning report" width="700" />
  <br/><em>asm audit security oss-ready — flags external URLs, shell execution, and credential access</em>
</p>

**What's the SKILL.md format?**
Every skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter (name, description, version) followed by markdown instructions the AI agent loads at runtime. Run `asm init my-skill` to scaffold one.

<summary><strong>Installing Skills from GitHub</strong></summary>

Install skills directly from GitHub repositories — supports both single-skill repos and multi-skill collections.

**Single-skill repo** (SKILL.md at root):

```bash
asm install github:user/my-skill
```

```bash
asm install github:user/my-skill#v1.0.0 -p claude
```

**Multi-skill repo** (skills in subdirectories):

```bash
asm install github:user/skills --path skills/code-review
```

```bash
asm install github:user/skills --all -p claude -y
```

Interactive picker:

```bash
asm install github:user/skills
```

**Subfolder URL** (auto-detects branch and path):

```bash
asm install https://github.com/user/skills/tree/main/skills/agent-config
```

```bash
asm install github:user/skills#main:skills/agent-config
```

**Private repos** (SSH transport):

```bash
asm install github:user/private-skill --transport ssh
```

Try HTTPS, fallback to SSH:

```bash
asm install github:user/private-skill -t auto
```

**Vercel skills CLI** (delegates to `npx skills add`, then registers in asm):

```bash
asm install github:user/skills --method vercel --skill my-skill
```

```bash
asm install https://github.com/user/skills -m vercel --skill my-skill -y
```

**Other options:**

```bash
asm install github:user/my-skill --name custom-name
```

```bash
asm install github:user/my-skill --force
```

```bash
asm install github:user/my-skill -p claude --yes --json
```

**Source format:** `github:owner/repo[#branch-or-tag]` or `github:owner/repo#ref:path` for subfolder installs. HTTPS GitHub URLs with `/tree/` paths are also supported — the branch and subfolder are auto-detected.

**Install flags:**

| Flag                     | Description                                                |

| `--name <name>`          | Override skill directory name                              |
| `--path <subdir>`        | Install a specific skill from a subdirectory               |
| `--all`                  | Install all skills found in the repo                       |
| `-m, --method <method>`  | Install method: `default` or `vercel` (default: `default`) |
| `--skill <name>`         | Alias for `--path` (Vercel skills CLI compatibility)       |
| `-t, --transport <mode>` | Transport: `https`, `ssh`, or `auto` (default: `auto`)     |
| `-f, --force`            | Overwrite if skill already exists                          |

**Multi-skill repo support:** When a repo doesn't have `SKILL.md` at the root, `asm` automatically scans for skills in subdirectories (up to 3 levels deep). In interactive mode, it presents a numbered picker. Use `--path` to target a specific skill or `--all` to batch-install everything.

The install command clones the repository, validates `SKILL.md` files, scans for security warnings, previews skill metadata, and installs to the selected provider's global skill directory. Requires `git` on PATH.

<summary><strong>Configuration</strong></summary>

On first run, a config file is created at `~/.config/agent-skill-manager/config.json` with 15 default providers, all enabled:

```

- **Enable providers** — Set `"enabled": true` to start scanning a provider
- **Custom paths** — Add arbitrary directories via `customPaths`
- **Disable providers** — Set `"enabled": false` to skip scanning a provider
- **Preferences** — Set default scope and sort order

Manage config from the CLI (`asm config show|path|reset|edit`) or toggle providers in the TUI by pressing `c`.

<summary><strong>SKILL.md Format</strong></summary>

Every skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file. The file starts with a YAML frontmatter block followed by markdown instructions that the AI agent loads at runtime.

### Frontmatter

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: "A short description of what this skill does"
license: "MIT"
compatibility: "Claude Code, Codex"
allowed-tools: Bash Read Grep Glob WebFetch
effort: medium
metadata:
  version: 1.0.0
  creator: "Your Name <you@example.com>"
---
```

| Field              | Required | Description                                         |
| ------------------ | :------: | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`             |   yes    | Unique skill identifier (used in list/search)       |
| `description`      |   yes    | One-line summary shown in listings                  |
| `license`          |    no    | SPDX license identifier (e.g., `MIT`, `Apache-2.0`) |
| `compatibility`    |    no    | Comma-separated list of compatible AI agents        |
| `allowed-tools`    |    no    | Space or comma-delimited tool names the skill uses  |
| `effort`           |    no    | Effort level: `low`, `medium`, `high`, or `max`     |
| `metadata.version` |    no    | Semver version string (defaults to `0.0.0`)         |
| `metadata.creator` |    no    | Author name and optional email                      |

> **Version resolution:** `asm` prefers `metadata.version` over a top-level `version` field. If neither is present, the version defaults to `0.0.0`. Both formats are supported for backward compatibility.

### Body

The markdown body after the frontmatter is loaded by the AI agent as the skill's instructions. A typical structure:

```markdown
# my-skill

Describe what this skill does here.

## When to Use

- Trigger conditions for this skill

## Instructions

- Step-by-step instructions for the agent
```

### Scaffold a new skill

Creates `my-skill/SKILL.md` in the default provider:

```bash
asm init my-skill
```

Creates in Claude Code's skill directory:

```bash
asm init my-skill -p claude
```
